    Whenever you face a problem where the output is very large, **you should always avoid** two things:

    1. Making a lot of calls to :code:`System.out`
    2. Concatenating a lot of strings

    To illustrate this consider the following simple problem:

    **Input:** A single integer :math:`n`

    **Output:** A string containing :math:`n` times the character 'a'

    For for example, on input :math:`5` you should output the string "aaaaa".
