    In this task we are going to see two simple applications of binary search related to square root computations.

    The first problem that we are going to solve is the following:

        Given a positive integer :math:`n` find the largest integer :math:`x` such that :math:`x^2 \leq n`.

    We are going to reason in the same way as we did to find an element in a sorted array.

    Suppose that we pick some value :math:`m` and compare :math:`m^2` to :math:`n`. What can we deduce?

    Since the function :math:`x \mapsto x^2` in *non-decresing*, we have the same kind of properties that we had with our sorted array:

    - if :math:`m^2 < n` then we can dismiss all values :math:`x < m`
    - if :math:`m^2 > n` then we can dismiss all values :math:`x > m`
