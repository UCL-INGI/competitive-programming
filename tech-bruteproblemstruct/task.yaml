    In some problems it is possible to identify some structure in the solution.

    To illustrate this we are going to solve problem E from BAC 2014.

    **Pickup and Delivery**

    A futuristic pickup and delivery company is considering the use of translocators in their buisness. A translocator is a device that allows the user to teleport himself. It has the two following functions:

    - Destroy the current portal if one exists and create one at you current location.

    - Teleport yourselft to the portal. The portal is destroyed.

    Note that this means that there can only be one portal at a given time. Both these actions are instantaneous and take no time to execute.

    Given a map, the location of the company headquarters H, the pickup location P and the delivery location D, they would like to know what is the minimum time it takes to go from H to P and then to D knowing that you have a translocator available.

    Note that you can use the translocator any number of times.

    **Example:**

    Suppose the map is given by the following graph.

    .. image:: tech-bruteproblemstruct/image.png

    The best solution is to go from :math:`H` to :math:`D` and drop the translocator. Then go to the pickup location :math:`P`, pickup the goods and then teleport yourself back to :math:`D`. The total time will be :math:`4`.
