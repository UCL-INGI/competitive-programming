    We are going to see that we can very easily compute a topological order of a graph using DFS.

    As with most DFS derived algorithms, all we need to do is to reason about the DFS tree. For clarity we will add the relevant code again:

    .. code:: java

        static void dfsVisit(int u) {
            state[u] = OPEN;
            for(int v : g[u]) {
                if(state[v] == UNV) {
                    dfsVisit(v);
                } else if(state[v] == OPEN) {
                    // (u, v) is a cycle edge
                }
            }
            state[u] = CLOSED;
        }



    We are going to argue that:

        **Theorem:**

        In an *acyclic* graph, when a node becomes :math:`CLOSED` then
        all of its out-neighbours are already closed.

        *Proof:*

        Suppose that we are executing :code:`dfsVisit(u)`. Let's consider
        any out-neighbour :math:`v` of :math:`u` and see why at the end
        of the :code:`for` loop, :math:`v` must be :math:`CLOSED`. We
        consider 3 cases depending on the state of :math:`v` when it was
        inspected in the loop:

            1. :math:`v` was :math:`CLOSED`: then it will also be closed
            at the end of the loop, there is nothing to prove;

            2. :math:`v` was :math:`UNV`: then we called
            :code:`dfsVisit(v)` and at the end of that call, :math:`v`
            became :math:`CLOSED`. Hence it will also be closed at the
            end of :code:`dfsVisit(u)`;

            3. :math:`v` was :math:`OPEN`: this means that :math:`(u,
            v)` is a *cycle edge* which is impossible since we assumed
            that the input graph was acyclic.

    **In short**: in an acyclic graph a node always becomes :math:`CLOSED` *after* all of its out-neighbours.

    Recall that in a topological order, we want a node to be placed anywhere *before* all of its out-neighborus. This means that, *the order in which the nodes are closed* must be, if one exists, the *reverse order of a topological order*.

    Therefore, we can compute a topological order of a graph by putting the nodes in a list when we close them. By what we've seen above we will get a topological order by reversing that list.

    In our implementation we will use an array instead of a list and put the elements from the end to the start of the array so that we don't need to reverse it in the end. An alternative is to use a stack but we did not opt for this solution because in most applications we need those nodes in an array afterwards anyway so that we can access the i-th element of the order in constant time.

    .. code:: java

        static final int UNV = 0, OPEN = 1, CLOSED = 2;
        static LinkedList<Integer>[] g;
        static int[] state;
        static boolean foundCycle;

        static int[] toposort; // toposort will have the node indexes in topological order
        static int toposortIndex; // to keep track where to put the next node

        static void toposort() {
            foundCycle = false;
            state = new int[g.length];
            toposort = new int[g.length];
            toposortIndex = g.length - 1;
            for(int u = 0; u < g.length; u++) {
                if(state[u] == UNV) {
                    dfsVisit(u);
                }
            }
        }

        static void dfsVisit(int u) {
            state[u] = OPEN;
            for(int v : g[u]) {
                if(state[v] == UNV) {
                    dfsVisit(v);
                } else if(state[v] == OPEN) {
                    // (u, v) is a cycle edge, the graph contains a cycle
                    foundCycle = true;
                }
            }
            // add u to the topological order
            // note that we start from the end since we want to reverse the closing order
            toposort[toposortIndex--] = u;
            state[u] = CLOSED;
        }

    At the end of the execution of :code:`toposort()`, if :math:`foundCycle` is :math:`false` then :math:`toposort` will contain the nodes of the graph in topological order.
