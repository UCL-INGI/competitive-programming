    Dynamic Programming (DP for short) in a fundamental technique in the development of efficient algorithms.

    Mastering this technique will allow you to solve a lot of problem that seem intractable at first.

    We will start by studying the Knapsack problem and use it to illustrate several aspects of DP, namely:

    - Top-down DP vs Bottom-up DP
    - The DP state graph
    - Reconstructing the solution
    - DP memory reduction.
