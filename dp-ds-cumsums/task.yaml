    In this task we will start looking into ways in which DP is used to stucture data to efficiently answer queries.

    We will start with cumulative sums.

    Given an array :math:`a`, and we want to be able to compute cumulative sums its subarrays efficiently. More formally, given two indexes :math:`i \leq j`, we want to compute the value of

    .. math::

       \sum_{k = i}^{j} a[i] = a[i] + a[i + 1] + \ldots + a[j]


    To simplify the notations, we will denote this sum by :math:`i` to :math:`j` by :math:`S(i, j)`.
