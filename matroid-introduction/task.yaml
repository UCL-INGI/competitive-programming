    A matroid :math:`M` is a pair :math:`(E, I)` where :math:`E` is a finite set (call **ground set**) and :math:`I` is a family of subsets of :math:`E` (called **independent sets**) with the following properties:

    1. The empty set is independent:

    .. math::

        \emptyset \in I

    2. A subset of an independent set is independent:

    .. math::

        \textrm{if B \in I and A \subseteq B \Rightarrow A \in I}
