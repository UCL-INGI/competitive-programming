    A matroid :math:`M` is a pair :math:`(E, I)` where :math:`E` is a finite set (call **ground set**) and :math:`I` is a family of subsets of :math:`E` (called **independent sets**) with the following properties:

    1. The empty set is independent:

    .. math::

        \emptyset \in I

    2. A subset of an independent set is independent:

    .. math::

        \textrm{if } B \in I \textrm{ and } A \subseteq B \textrm{ then } A \in I

    3. If :math:`A, B` are independent and :math:`|B| = |A| + 1`, then there is an element :math:`x \in B \setminus A` such that :math:`A \cup \{x\}` is independent:

    .. math::

        \textrm{if } A, B \in I \textrm{ and } |B| \subseteq |A| + 1 \textrm{ then there exists } x \in B \setminus A \textrm{ such that } A \cup \{x\} \in I

    All of this might seem very abstract so lets give two examples of well know matroids.

    **Spanning trees**

    Let :math:`G` be a graph with edge set :math:`E`.

    Let's say that a subset of edges of :math:`G` is independent if it form a sub-forest of :math:`G`. In other words, if it contains no cycles.

    We are going to see that this forms a matroid over :math:`E`. For this we need to check that properties :math:`1, 2` and :math:`3` above hold.

    1. Clearly, if we select :math:`0` edges, we get a subgraph that contains no cycles.

    2. Let :math:`F \subseteq E` be a subset of edges that has no cycles. Then, it is also clear that any subset of :math:`F` also contains no cycles.
