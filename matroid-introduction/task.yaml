    A matroid :math:`M` is a pair :math:`(X, I)` where :math:`X` is a finite set (call **ground set**) and :math:`I` is a family of subsets of :math:`E` (called **independent sets**) with the following properties:

    1. The empty set is independent:

    .. math::

        \emptyset \in I

    2. A subset of an independent set is independent:

    .. math::

        \textrm{if } B \in I \textrm{ and } A \subseteq B \textrm{ then } A \in I

    3. If :math:`A, B` are independent and :math:`|A| = |B| + 1`, then there is an element :math:`x \in A \setminus B` such that :math:`B \cup \{x\}` is independent:

    .. math::

        \textrm{if } A, B \in I \textrm{ and } |A| \subseteq |B| + 1 \textrm{ then there exists } x \in A \setminus B \textrm{ such that } B \cup \{x\} \in I

    All of this might seem very abstract so lets give two examples of well know matroids.

    **Spanning trees**

    Let :math:`G` be a graph with edge set :math:`E`.

    Let's say that a subset of edges of :math:`G` is independent if it contains no cycles (i.e. the subset forms a forest).

    We are going to see that this forms a matroid over :math:`E`. For this we need to check that properties :math:`1, 2` and :math:`3` above hold.

    **1**


    Clearly, if we select :math:`0` edges, we get a subgraph that contains no cycles.

    **2**


    Let :math:`F \subseteq E` be a subset of edges that has no cycles. Then, it is also clear that any subset of :math:`F` also contains no cycles.

    **3**


    Let :math:`F_1, F_2` be acyclic subgraphs (forests) such that :math:`|F_1| = |F_2| + 1`. We need to prove that there exists an edge :math:`e` that is in :math:`F_1` but not in :math:`F_2` such that if we add it to :math:`F_2` it remains acyclic.

    This one requires some insight to prove. Let's start by showing the following.

        **Lemma:**

        The number of connected components in a forest with :math:`n` nodes and :math:`m` edges is :math:`n - m`.

    **Proof**

    Let :math:`c` be the number of connected components. Let :math:`v_i` be the number of nodes in the :math:`i`-th connected component and :math:`e_i` the number of edges. Since each connected component is a tree (acyclic), we have :math:`e_i = v_i - 1`. The total number of edges, :math:`m`, is the sum of the number of edges in each connected component. Therefore,

    .. math::

        m = \sum_{i = 1}^c e_i = \sum_{i = 1}^c (v_i - 1) = n - c \Rightarrow c = n - m
