            You have been given the job of forming the quiz teams for the next `MCA CPCI Quiz Championship'.
            There are :math:`n = 2 k` students interested to participate and you have to form :math:`k` teams, each team consisting of two members. Since the members have to practice together, all the students want their members house as near as possible. Let :math:`x_1` be the distance between the houses of group 1,
            :math:`x_2` be the distance between the houses of group 2 and so on. You have to make the groups so that  :math:`x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_{k}` is minimized.
