            You have been given the job of forming the quiz teams for the next *MCA CPCI Quiz Championship*.
            There are :math:`n = 2k` students interested to participate and you have to form :math:`k` teams, each team consisting of two members. Since the members have to practice together, all the students want their members house as near as possible. Let :math:`x_1` be the distance between the houses of group 1,
            :math:`x_2` be the distance between the houses of group 2 and so on. You have to make the groups so that  :math:`x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_{k}` is minimized.

            **Input**

            - One line with one integer :math:`n` giving the number of students.

            - :math:`n` lines each with two integers :math:`x_i, y_i` giving the coordinates of the students houses.


            **Output**

            One line with a number giving the minimum total distance if we pair the students in an optimal way.

            **Limits**

            * :math:`n = 2k` where :math:`1 \leq k \leq 8`
            * :math:`0 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 1000`
