            Before the invention of book-printing, it was very hard to make a copy of a book. All the contents had to be re-written by hand by so called scribers. The scriber had been given a book and after several months he finished its copy. One of the most famous scribers lived in the 15th century and his name
            was Xaverius Endricus Remius Ontius Xendrianus (Xerox). Anyway, the work was very annoying and boring. And the only way to speed it up was to hire more scribers.
