    The algorithm that we presented in the `maxflow task <graphs-maxflow>`_ is due to Jack Edmonds and Richard Karp and thus named Edmonds-Karp. The idea of finding paths in the residual graph was already know. Their contribution was to show that the algorithm runs in polynomial time if we use BFS to find the paths. These class of algorithms are callled *augmenting path algorithms*.

    In general, it is easy to find an upper bound for the running time an augmenting path algorithm:

    Whenever we are able to find a path, we push at least one new unit of flow. Therefore the total flow is strictly increasing so that we will perform at most :math:`F` path finding iterations, where :math:`F` is the maximum flow. Thus the complexity is :math:`O(F (V + E))` if we use an :math:`O(V + E)` algorithm to find the path such as DFS of BFS.

    However this is not a very good news as we usually do not want the complexity to depend on the *value* of the answer since it could mean that even on a very small graph with, say :math:`F = 10^{10}`, the algorithm would take forever to run.

    We are going to show that using BFS to find the paths, the runs in :math:`O(V E^2)`.
