    The algorithm that we presented in the `maxflow task <graphs-maxflow>`_ is due to Jack Edmonds and Richard Karp and thus named Edmonds-Karp.

    We are going to argue why the algorithm runs in :math:`O(V E^2)` and make some observations of what would happend if we used DFS to find the paths instead of BFS.

    Be warned that this section will be a bit more theoretical.
