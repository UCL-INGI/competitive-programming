    This is a problem from the Belgium Algorithm Contest Round 3 - 2017.

    An undirected graph is said to be *bipartite* if it its nodes can be partitioned into two disjoint sets :math:`L, R` such that there are not edges between two elements in the same set.

    Graphically, a bipartite graph can

        header: |
            Bob, Alice and Craig are going on a school field trip. There are a total of :math:`n` students that will travel on two buses. Both buses have capacity :math:`n` and the kids can be assigned to the buses in any way the teachers want. The teachers have noticed that
            the kids are troublesome when they travel with their friends.

            The teachers know that gossip ends friendships. Obviously two people will not gossip about a third one if the three of them are on the same bus. Since everyone loves gossip, the kids in one bus will always gossip about everyone that is on the other bus.

            Therefore the teachers would like to split the kids between the buses so that after the trip, no two kids are friends because of gossip.

            It is very evil but such a relief for them. Could you help them know whether their evil plan is achievable?

            **Input**

            The first line of the input contains two integers :math:`n` and :math:`m` giving the number of kids in the class and the number of friendships (pairs of kids that are friends with each other).

            Then follow :math:`m` lines each with two integers :math:`x` and :math:`y` meaning that kid :math:`x` is friends with kid :math:`y`. For simplicity, the kids are numbered from :math:`0` to :math:`n - 1`.
            Assume that friendships are symmetric, meaning that is :math:`x` is friends with :math:`y` then :math:`y` is friends with :math:`x`.

            **Constraints**

            * :math:`1 \leq r, c \leq 1000`
            * :math:`1 \leq n \leq 10000`
            * :math:`0 \leq m \leq min(50000, n (n - 1) / 2)`
            * :math:`0 \leq x, y < n`
            * :math:`x \neq y`

            **Output**

            A single line with 'yes' if the teachers can split the kids so that all friendships are destroyed by gossip or 'no' otherwise.
