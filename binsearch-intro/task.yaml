    Binary search is a fundamental technique in the development of algorithms and an essential tool in your algorithmist toolkit.

    In its most pure form, binary search is used to find an element in a sorted array. So let's start by solving that problem.

        Given a sorted array :math:`a` of :math:`n` integers, how can we efficiently determine whether it contains a given target element :math:`t`?

    Denote by :math:`a[i:j]` the subarray of :math:`a` from indexes :math:`i` to :math:`j` (inculive), that is, :math:`a[i], a[i + 1], \ldots, a[j]`.

    Let's say we check element at position :math:`i`. If :math:`a[i] = t` then we can report that :math:`a` contains :math:`t` at position :math:`i`. Otherwise, we either have :math:`a[i] < t` or :math:`a[i] > t`.

    Since :math:`a` is sorted, if :math:`a[i] < t` then we know that all elements before index :math:`i`, that is, :math:`a[0], a[1], \ldots, a[i - 1]` are also smaller than :math:`t`. Hence we can discard them and save us the trouble of comparing all of the against :math:`t`. In other words, we recuded the problem of finding :math:`t` in :math:`a` to the problem of finding :math:`t` in :math:`a[i+1:n-1]`.

    On the other case, when :math:`a[i] > t` we can apply an analogous reasoning to discard all elements after index :math:`i`.

    **Conclusion:** by checking any index :math:`i` we will either find :math:`i` or be able to discard all indexes smaller than :math:`i` or all indexes greater than :math:`i`. If we select :math:`i` to be the middle index, then we are sure that, in the worse case, we can discard *half* of the elements of the array.

    But then what do we do once we discarded half of the array? We can repeat the same process on the new smaller array and discard half again and so on until a single element is left.
