    Binary search is a fundamental technique in the development of algorithms and an essential tool in your algorithmist toolkit.

    In its most pure form, binary search is used to find an element in a sorted array. So let's start by solving that problem.

        Given a sorted array :math:`a` of integers, how can we efficiently determine whether it contains a given target element :math:`t`?

    Let's say we check element at position :math:`i`. If :math:`a[i] = t` then we can report that :math:`a` contains :math:`t` at position :math:`i`. Otherwise, we either have :math:`a[i] < t` or :math:`a[i] > t`.
