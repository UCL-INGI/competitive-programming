        name: Knockout Tournament
        header: |-
            Laura is organising a knockout tournament, in which her friend Dale takes part. Laura would like to maximise the probability of Dale winning the tournament by arranging the games in a
            favourable way.  She does not know how to do it, so she asked you for help.  Naturally, you refuse to cooperate with such a deplorable actâ€”but then you realise that it is a very nice puzzle!

            When the number of players is a power of two, the tournament setup can be described recursively as follows:  the players are divided into two equal groups that each play their own knockout
            tournament, after which the winners of both tournaments play each other. Once a player loses, they are out of the tournament.
            When the number of players is not a power of two, some of the last players in the starting line-up advance from the first round automatically so that in the second round the number of players left is a power of two, as shown the figure below.

            Every player has a rating indicating their strength. A player with rating :math:`a` wins a game against a player with rating :math:`b` with probability :math:`\frac{a}{a + b}` (independently of any previous matches played).

            Laura as the organiser can order the starting line-up of players in any way she likes. What is the maximum probability of Dale winning the tournament?


            **Input**

            - One line with an integer :math:`n`, the total number of players.

            - :math:`n` lines, each with an integer :math:`r`, the rating of a player. The first rating given is Dale's rating.

            **Constraints**

            * :math:`2 \leq n \leq 4096`
            * :math:`1 \leq r \leq 10^5`

            **Output**

            Output the maximum probability with which Dale can win the tournament given a favourable setup. Your answer should have an absolute or relative error of at most :math:`10^{-6}`.
