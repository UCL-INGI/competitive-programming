    **Some words of caution**

    The goal of this course is to teach you algorithms for competitive programming. Even though it is designed for competitive programming, we believe that it will be interesting for any computer scientist wishing to improve his algorithmic and data structure design skills.

    We will avoid going into deep teoretical proofs and focus on a more practical approach. There is already a lot of books and online material containing proofs that these algorithms are correct. We are hoping to explain them in a way that gives you the intuition of why they must be correct. We are not claiming in any way that intuition is a replacement for formal proofs. We encourage each one of you to dig deeper and formalize what we give you. This will only make you stronger when you have a new problem to solve.

    Another goal of this course is to make you be able to implement all these algorithms and data structures. From our experience, most students learn a bunch of algorithms while studying to be compute scientists but then take forever to implement them.

    This is not a course about software engineering so we will code in a way that is usually frowned upon by this community. Our goal is not to develop an algorithmic library so we will not focus on desining our code in a way that is reusable and general but rather we want to have a compact code that can easily by typed on a contest environment. Our goal is to write code that solves a specific problem and not a set of similar problems. Making the code more general usually makes it longer and thus you will loose time during the contest to type it. Actually, we encourage the students of this course to **always type the solution of each problem from scratch**. This will help you memorise the algorithms so that you don't forget how they work. It will also free some space on your cheatsheets!

    However, if you wish to develop a state of the art algorithmic library, by following this course you will learn most of what you need. You will just have to rewrite the code in a way that it is less problem oriented so that in can be used to solve several different situation.

    The code in this course is written in Java. There is not reason for this exceept for personal preference. The language you use should also be the one with which you are the most familiar. Except for python, in today's contests judges make sure that any reasonable solution is accepted in all available languages. So even if Java is slower, any reasonable solution written in it will be accepted. Note that this was not always true so if you program in Java you will find some old problems where most Java solution are too slow.

    Any code provided here should easily be translatable in other langauges as we are not going to use anything that is specific to Java (except for the syntax of course).

    The general structure of a Java solution to an programming contest problem looks like this:

    .. code:: java

        public class ProblemName {

            static int someProblemInput;
            static int[] anotherProblemInput;

            public static void main(String[] args) {
                Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);
                // read the input
                someProblemInput = reader.nextInt();
                // ...
                reader.close()
                solve();
            }

            static void solve() {
                // the code that solved the problem
                // ...
                // print the output
                System.out.println("The answer is 42");
            }

            static int someUsefulFunction() {
                // code
            }

            static class SomeUsefulClass {

                public SomeUsefulClass() {
                    // code
                }

            }

        }

    You are free to not follow this template at all. **Do not copy paste it! Write your own code!** The goal is just to show that everything is usually coded statically.

    **New to programming contests?**

    If you are new to programming contests then *welcome*!

    In a typical ACM-ICPC like contest you be given some number of problems and some time to solve as many problems as you can. The winner is the one with the most problems solved. In case of ties, they are broken by the total number of minutes used to solve the problem. To solve a problem, most systems allow you to submit a **single file**. This will then be compiled and ran on some number of predefined test cases. Then you answers will be checked to see if they are corrected. You they are **all** correct, your solution is accepted. If any one of them is wrong you will get no points at all, even if you solve 99 out of 100 test cases.

    Your solution is evaluated with respect to three aspects:

    1. Whether or not the outputs that is procudes are correct with respect to the problem specification.
    2. Whether your algorithm is fast enough.
    3. Wehther your algorithm uses a reasonable amout of memory.

    The verdicts you can receive are the following:

    * **Accepted**: your solution passed all test cases.
    * **Wrong answer**: your solution procudes a wrong answer in at least one test case.
    * **Time limit exceeded**: your solution exceeded the time limit set of the problem in at least one test case.
    * **Memory limit exceeded**: your soluton exceeded the memory limit while solving at leasy one of test case.
    * **Compilation error**: the code you provided does not compile.
