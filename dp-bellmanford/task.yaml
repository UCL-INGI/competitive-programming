    In the previous task, we say a DP formulation for the shortest path problem with positive edge weights from a given source node :math:`s`:

    .. math::

        dp(s) = 0

    and for :math:`v \neq s`

    .. math::

        dp(v) = \min_{u \ \textrm{in-neighbor of} \ v} dp(u) + w(u, v)

    The state graph is the same as the input graph and so this formulation will work if and only if the input graph is acyclic.

    So what can we do if the input graph contains cycles, is it still possible to solve it with dynamic programming? *YES*. But we need to change the formulation so that the resulting state graph is acyclic.

    Doing so requires some imagination and is problem dependent. However there are some general tricks.

    Suppose that you have a fomrulation with states :math:`s \in S`.
    Imagine that you add a parameter :math:`i` to the formulation and manage to make sure that each state :math:`(s, i)` **only depends** on states :math:`(s, j)` with :math:`j < i`. Then your new state graph is clearly acyclic since any path on it

    .. math::

        (s_1, i_1), (s_2, i_2), \ldots, (s_k, i_k)

    must has have a strincly increasing :math:`i` coordinates

    .. math::

        i_1 < i_2 < \ldots < i_k

    This might seem a bit abstract so let's see a concrete example with the shortest path problem.

    Define a new state :math:`(v, i)` with the following subproblem definition

        :math:`dp(v, i)` equals the length of the shortest path from :math:`s` to :math:`v` that traverses at most :math:`i` edges.
