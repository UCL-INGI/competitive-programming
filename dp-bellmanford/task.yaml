    In the previous task, we say a DP formulation for the shortest path problem with positive edge weights from a given source node :math:`s`:

    .. math::

        dp(s) = 0

    and for :math:`v \neq s`

    .. math::

        dp(v) = \min_{u \ \textrm{in-neighbor of} \ v} dp(u) + w(u, v)

    The state graph is the same as the input graph and so this formulation will work if and only if the input graph is acyclic.
