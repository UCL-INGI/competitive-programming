    The **maximum sum subarray problem** is the following:

    Given an array :math:`a` with :math:`n` integers, we want to find a subarray of :math:`a` such that the sum of its elements is as large as possible.

    Recall that subarray is a continuous range, you cannot skip some elements. Otherwise the problem would be trivial as one could just pick all positive elements.

    **Example:**

    .. image:: dp-intro/maxsubarray.png

    The goal of this task is to develop an :math:`O(n)` algorithm for this problem.

    Let :math:`dp[i]` denote the maximum sum we can make with the subarray formet by the first :math:`i` elements of :math:`a`,  :math:`a[0], a[1], \ldots, a[i]`.

    For example, :math:`dp[5]` will be the maximum sum subarray considering only :math:`a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3], a[4], a[5]`.

    **Example:**

    .. image:: dp-intro/maxsubarray2.png

    The answer to our problem is :math:`dp[n - 1]` since this state consider the whole array :math:`a`.

    In DP we need to relate the answer to one problem with the answer to smaller subproblems. How can we relate :math:`dp[i]` with :math:`dp[i - 1]`?
