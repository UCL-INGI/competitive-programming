    Most of the content of this course related to geometry is take from the "Handbook of geometry for competitive
    programmers" written by Victor Lecomte, which was, by far, the strongest ICPC participant that our university has ever had.

    In contrast with this course, the code found in the book is in :code:`C++`.

    The source of the book can be found in his `github page <https://github.com/vlecomte/cp-geo>`_. You can download the pdf from `here <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wmsyxpbeELd9XHP7sdr4y3BgfrYB8KXE/view?usp=sharing>`_. We advise you to download the sources and compile them so that you have the latest content of the book.
