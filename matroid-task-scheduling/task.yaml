context: Imagine that you have :math:`n` tasks to schedule on a single processor.
    Each task takes exactly :math:`1` unit of time to complete. However, each task
    has a positive deadline :math:`d_i` and a positive cost :math:`c_i` that is paid
    for each task that finishes after its deadline. It does not matter how late the
    task is finished, you always pay the same cost as long as it is delayed.
