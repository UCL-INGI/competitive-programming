    Imagine that you have :math:`n` tasks :math:`T` to schedule on a single processor. Each task takes exactly :math:`1` unit of time to complete. However, each task has a positive deadline :math:`d_i` and a positive cost :math:`c_i` that is paid for each task that finishes after its deadline. It does not matter how late the task is finished, you always pay the same cost as long as it is delayed.

    ----

    **Example:**

    Imagine that we have :math:`n = 7` tasks with the following deadlines and costs:

    |

    .. image:: matroid-task-scheduling/matroid3.png

    |

    Consider the following schedule:

    |

    .. image:: matroid-task-scheduling/matroid2.png

    |

    Each box represents a task a the time below represent the time at which it was scheduled. For instance, task :math:`3` was sheduled at time :math:`1` and task :math:`4` at time :math:`4`. On the top we show the deadlines of the tasks, for instance, tasks :math:`1, 3, 4` and :math:`6` all have dealine :math:`4`.

    A task is represented in green if it is scheduled before its deadline and in red otherwise. The total cost of a schedule is the sum of the costs of the tasks in red. In this case it is:

    .. math::

        c_5 + c_4 + c_2 + c_6 = 3 + 4 + 6 + 2 = 15

    ----

    Define a subset of tasks to be *independent* if there exists a schedule for these tasks such that they are all finished before their dealines.

    We are going to prove that :math:`(T, I)` is a matroid, where :math:`I` is the set of all subsets of independent tasks, as defined above.

    Let :math:`A` be a set of tasks. Denote by :math:`N(t, A)` the number of tasks in :math:`A` with deadline at most :math:`t`. For instance, in the above example :math:`N(4, \{2, 4, 7\}) = 2` since tasks :math:`2` and :math:`4` have deadline :math:`\leq 4`.

    It is easy to prove that:

        A set of tasks :math:`A` is independent if and only if :math:`N(t, A) \leq t` for each :math:`t = 1, \ldots, n`.

    The idea is the following:

    There is at most one task with deadline :math:`1` then, it it exists, we schedule that task at time :math:`1`. Then, it remains at most one task with deadline :math:`2`. If it exsits, we schedule it a time :math:`2`. If we continue the same way, at the :math:`i` step, we have at most one task with deadline at time :math:`i` so we are always able to schedule each one of the tasks before its deadline. Thus :math:`A` must be independent.

    |

    We now prove that :math:`(T, I)` is a matroid.

    **1:**

    Clearly, if we select :math:`0` tasks, we get a schedule with no delays.

    **2:**

    Let :math:`A \subseteq T` be a subset of tasks that we can schedule without delays. Then any subset of :math:`B` can also be scheduled without delay by scheduling in the same way they where scheduled in :math:`A`.

    **3:**

    As usual, this step is more involved.

    Let :math:`A, B` by an independent sets such that :math:`|A| = |B| + 1`. We need to prove that there exists a task in :math:`x \in A \setminus B` such that it is possible to schedule all taks in :math:`B \cup \{ x \}` without delays.
