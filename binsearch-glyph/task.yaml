            Problem G from NWERC 2017

            You are an archaeologist working at an excavation site where your team has found hundreds of
            clay tablets containing glyphs written in some ancient language. Not much is known about the
            language yet, but you know that there are only six different glyphs, each of them in the shape
            of a regular polygon with one vertex pointing to the right (see Figure G.1(a) below). Only the
            boundary of each polygon is carved out of the clay.
