    In this task we will see that the same problem can have several DP formulations that can be more suited for some situations.

    Recall that we defined previously the DP states as:

      :math:`dp(i, c)` is the maximum value we can obtain by
      selecting a subset of the objects :math:`i, i + 1, \ldots, n - 1`
      from a knapsack of capacity :math:`c`.
