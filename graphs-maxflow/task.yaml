    In this task we are going to learn how to compute the maximum flow between two nodes in a graph. In the maximum flow problem each edge has a capacity and we aim at sending the maximum amout of flow (information) between a souce node :math:`s` and a sink node :math:`t` in a graph without exceeding the capacity of any edge.

        **Example:**

        In the following graph, we can send a total of 6 units of flow
        as shown. The numbers on the edges represent the edge
        capacities.

        In this example all the edges leaving the source are saturated
        (have no capacity remaining). Thus we know that must be the
        maximum flow as we would never be able to send more than this.

    By looking at such an example it seems that we can compute the maximum flow simply by finding paths from :math:`s` to :math:`t`
    and pushing as much as we can each time. As we will see, this is a little too greedy to work so we will need to refine the idea a bit in order for it to work.

        **Example:**

        Consider the same graph but pushing flow on a different set of
        paths. Every time we find a path from :math:`s` to :math:`t` we
        increment the total flow by the minimum capacity edge on that
        path. We label each edge with :math:`f / c` where :math:`f`
        is the flow currently passing on that edge and :math:`c` is its
        capacity.

        The first path found was :math:`(s,4,3,t)` and we could push 1
        unit of flow.

        |

        Then we found path :math:`(s,1,2,t)` and pushed 3 units of flow.

        |

        |

        After that we found path :math:`(s,4,t)` and pushed one more
        unit of flow. Now there are no more paths from :math:`s` to
        :math:`t` with positive capacity in the graph so we cannot push
        more flow.

        As you can see, we were only able to push a total of 5 units of     flow. However on the first example we saw that the maximum flow     is 6. This shows that simply finding paths with positive
        capacity and pushing flow does yield an optimal solution.

    If we look at the final flow that we obtained before, we can actually understand how we could manage to send one more unit of flow.

    The flow going from :math:`3` to :math:`t` could come from path :math:`(s, 1, 3, t)` instead and the flow on :math:`(4, 3, t)` could be redirected on edge :math:`(4, t)`.

    But how can we find this changes? It turn out that a simple path finding algorithm can achieve it. If you think about it, what we did is as if we had pushed one unit of flow on the following "path":

    This is not really a path as edge :math:`(4, 3)` is traversed in the opposit direction. However if we defined that when we push flow on an edge, if the edge direction is correct then we **increase** the flow and when direction is reversed,  we **decrease** the flow, we end up exactly with the flow that we had after we redirected the flow.
