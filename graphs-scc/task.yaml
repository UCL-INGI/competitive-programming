    In this task we are going to learn how to compute the strongly connected components of a directed graph.

    A graph is said to be strongly connected if there exists at least one path between any pair of nodes in that subset.

    The strongly connected components of a graph are the maximal strongly connected subgraphs of that graph.

      **Example:**

environment: python3
evaluate: best
groups: false
input_random: '0'
limits:
    output: '2'
    memory: '100'
    time: '30'
