    In this task we are going to learn how to compute the strongly connected components (SCC's) of a directed graph.

    A graph is said to be strongly connected if there exists at least one path between any pair of nodes in that subset.

    The strongly connected components of a graph are the maximal strongly connected subgraphs of that graph.

      **Example:**

      The following image show a graph with 4 SCC's. The nodes on the
      same SCC are colored with the same color.
