            In this simple problem you simply have to read a string from the standard input and output that same string into the standard output.

            **Input**

            A single line with a string :math:`s` having caracters from 'a' to 'z'.

            **Output**

            A single line with the input string.

            **Constraints**

            * :math:`1 \leq |s| \leq 1000` where :math:`|s|` denotes the number of characters of the string :math:`s`.

            **Sample Test Cases**

            `Sample input 1 <helloworld/1.in>`_

            `Sample output 1 <helloworld/1.ans>`_


            `Sample input 2 <helloworld/2.in>`_

            `Sample output 2 <helloworld/2.ans>`_
