            In this simple problem you simply have to read a string from the standard input and output that same string into the standard output.

            **Input**

            A single line with a string :math:`s` having caracters from 'a' to 'z'.

            **Output**

            A single line with the input string.

            **Constraints**

            * :math:`1 \leq |s| \leq 1000` where :math:`|s|` denots the number of characters of the string :math:`s`.
