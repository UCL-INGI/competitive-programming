    In this task we will focus on the problem of finding a path between two given nodes in a graph.

    Let :math:`s` be the source node and :math:`t` the destination node.
    We will keep which nodes have already been visited and which nodes still need to be processed in a queue. At each iteration we pick the node in front of the queue to be processed. Then we add all of its unvisited neighbors to the queue of nodes to process. If we continue in this way until there are no more nodes to process then we know that there is path from :math:`s` to :math:`t` if and only if :math:`t` was visited.

      Example:

      The following figure shows an execution of the this process with
      :math:`s = 0`.

      .. image:: graph-bfs/bfs.png

    .. code:: java

    Let's see what this looks like in Java. We will create a function :code:`bfsVisit` that takes as input the graph, the source and a set of visited nodes. The reason for passing the set of visited nodes as argument doing it like this is that usually we want

        static boolean pathExists(LinkedList<Integer>[] g, int s, int t) {
            // initialize the queue and visited set
            Queue<Integer> Q = new LinkedList<>();
            Q.add(s);
            BitSet visited = new BitSet();
            visited.set(s);
            // loop while there are nodes in the queue to process
            while(!Q.isEmpty()) {
                int u = Q.poll();
                // we are now processing node u
                for(int v : g[u]) {
                    // visit edge (u, v)
                    if(!visited.get(v)) {
                        // node v has not yet been visited, add  it
                        Q.add(v);
                        visited.set(v);
                    }
                }
            }
            // return whether a path exists
            return visited.get(t);
        }
