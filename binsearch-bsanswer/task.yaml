    Now that we have seen two basic examples of binary search we are going to generalize it and see how it can be applied to solve more complicated problems.

    Let's start by rewriting the :code:`integerSqrt`
environment: dafny
evaluate: best
groups: false
input_random: '0'
limits:
    output: '2'
    memory: '100'
    time: '30'
