    Now that we have seen two basic examples of binary search we are going to generalize it and see how it can be applied to solve more complicated problems.

    Let's start by rewriting the :code:`integerSqrt` as follows:

    .. code:: java

        static int integerSqrt(int n) {
            long L = 0;
            long R = n + 1;
            while(R - L >= 2) {
                long M = (L + R) / 2;
                if(check(M, n)) L = M; // dismiss all values < M
                else R = M; // dismiss all values > M
            }
            return (int)L;
        }

        static boolean check(long x, int n) {
            return x * x <= n;
        }

    It is essentially the same code, except that we extracted the check condition. When we read it like that we can see that what the code is doing is finding the maximum value such that the condition :code:`check` is true. And it will work because :code:`check` has the following property:

        When we vary :math:`x`, it is always *true* util some point and then always *false* after that point. We call such a property a **monotone property**.

    The following image illustrrates this:

    This means that we can actually use binary search to solve **any problem** in which we seek the largest value that satisfies some given property as long as that truth value of that property is **monotone**.

    Let's illustrate this on a real problem.

        **Plane purchase problem:**

        You want to purchase a plane to travel arround the world.

        You know the positions :math:`(x_i, y_i)` of all :math:`n` airports on which you are allowed to land. The cost of the planes is proportional to the maximum distance that it can travel. Therefore, you would like to know what is the minimum travel distance that a plane needs to be able to trabel so that you can travel between any two airports.

        Note that by travel we do not mean a direct flight, you don't mind to have to stop in some airports on the way to refuel your plane.
