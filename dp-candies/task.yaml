    In this task we will an example of parameter decution in DP.

    Broadly speaking, parameter reduction consists of eliminating some parameter in a DP formulation that can be decuded from the others.

    To illustrate this, consider the following simple problem. You have :math:`n` candies to give to 3 kids. Each candy as a value that represents how good it is. All kids agree on these values.
    The goal is to split the candies amongst the kinds so that the difference between the maximum total value and the minimum total value given to a kid is minimum.

    More formally, is :math:`V_i` is the sum of the values of the candies given to the :math:`i`-th kid then the goal is to minimize
    the balance of the candy distribution, that is, minimize :math:`max(V_1, V_2, V_3) - min(V_1, V_2, V_3)`.

      **Example**

      Consider the 6 candies :math:`c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4, c_5, c_6` shown
      in the picture below:

      .. image:: dp-candies/candy.png

      If we give :math:`c_1, c_2` to the first kid, :math:`c_3, c_4` to
      the second kid and :math:`c_5, c_6` to the third kid, we have
      :math:`V_1 = 4 + 3 = 7`, :math:`V_2 = 4 + 3 = 5` and :math:`V_3 =
      4 + 3 = 6`. So in this case the balance of the candy distribuiton
      is :math:`max(V_1, V_2, V_3) - min(V_1, V_2, V_3) = max(7, 5, 6) - min(7, 5, 6) = 7 - 5 = 2`.

      But we can do better! We can instead give :math:`c_1, c_3` to the
      first kid, :math:`c_2, c_4` to the second kid and :math:`c_5, c_6`
      to the third kid. In this case :math:`V_1 = V_2 = V_3 = 6` so the
      balance is 0.

    This problem is very naturally formulated as a top-down DP. For each candy we have 3 possible options: give to either the first, the second or the third kid. Thus a possible state can be a tuple :math:`(i, v_1, v_2, v_3)` meaning that we have already given candies :math:`0, \ldots, i - 1` making a total values of the :math:`i`-th kid equal to :math:`v_i`.
