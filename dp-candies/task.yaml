    In this task we will an example of parameter decution in DP.

    Broadly speaking consists of eliminating some parameter un a DP formulation that can be decudes from the others.

    To illustrate this, consider the following simple problem. You have :math:`n` candies to give to 3 kids. Each candy as a value that represents how good it is. All kids agree on these values.
    The goal is to split the candies amongst the kinds so that the difference between the maximum total value and the minimum total value given to a kid is minimum.

    More formally, is :math:`V_i` is the sum of the values of the candies given to the :math:`i`-th kid then the goal is to minimize

    .. math::

      max(V_1, V_2, V_3) - min(V_1, V_2, V_3)
