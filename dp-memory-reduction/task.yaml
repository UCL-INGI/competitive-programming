    We will now show how we can reduce the memory from :math:`O(n \cdot C)` to :math:`O(C)` of the bottom-up DP solution we developed for the Knapsack.

    This technique is not usually necessary in programming contests   but it is nice to know it anyway. It also illustrates one advantage of bottom-up DP compared to top-down DP.

    If we look at the recurrence:

    .. math::

      dp(i, c) = \max
       \begin{cases}
       dp(i - 1, c - w_i)       & \quad \text{take item $i$}\\
       dp(i - 1, c) & \quad \text{skip item $i$}
      \end{cases}

    We can observe that the values of states for a given :math:`i` only depend on the values for :math:`i - 1`. Thus, we don't need to keep
    the full matrix in memory, we only need to keep the last line.
